# Executive Summary

In this lab, we explore the key ahrdware in computers, mainly the memory hardware and CPU. We then explore how these hardware work together in a real life example to take inputs, process them, and output. Finally, we learn the relationship between decimal, binary, and hexadecimal number systems and learn how to convert between these numbers.

# Hardware
## Hard Drives and Memory
* What is the difference between latency and transfer rates in the performance of a hard drive?

Hard drive latency is the measure of time it takes for the hard drive to find the specific piece of data on the disk. Because Hard disk drives use a lot of mechanical parts, it takes time for the disk to spin and the reading arm inside to move to the right position to access the data. The transfer rates is the measure of how fast data can be transferred to and from the disk and the ocmputer. A common unit used to describe the speed is megabytes per second (MBps).

* How a solid state (SSD) hard drive is different from a traditional hard drive?

A solid state drive is different from traditional hard drives in that it lacks the mechanical disks to store data and instead uses stationary flash memory devices to store data persistently. Solid state drives offer many benefits over solid state drives. First and most importantly, SSDs are much faster then HDDs. Because it uses flash memory instead of disks, the SSD does not need to turn a disk and move and arm to access data, removing the latency that a HDD would normally have. Second, SSDs are more rliable than HDDs. Since SSDs forego the use of moving parts, there is no risk of mechanical failures such as dust landing on top of the disk or the scanning arm failing to move. Although SSDs are more expensive per byte than HDDs, SSDs continue to become cheaper and bigger as time goes on.

* Why does increasing RAM make the computer run faster?

All programs and the operating system require a certain amount of data to be loaded into RAM when they are started. If there is not enough RAM space for all the available applications at the same time, then the computer slows down because it has to wait on programs to be loaded in and out of RAM. Adding more RAM increases the total amount of data  allowing more programs or more RAM hungry programs to be run simultaneously.

* What is the difference between 64 and 32 bit data paths?

32-bit and 64-bit are used to describe the architecture of a program or a processor. 32-bits can reference 2^32 bytes of memory, while 64 bit can reference 2^64, making 64 bit systems much more powerful. 64-bit data paths rely on the 64-bit architectrure to handle larger processes, and as a result, can only be run on 64 bit systems while 32-bit data paths can be used in both 32-bit and 64-bit systems.

## ALU and Control Unit
* Explain the interaction of the control unit and ALU in the CPU

The arithmetic logic unit (ALU) is a core mechanism in the CPU that performs arithmetic and logic operations. It can be thought of as the engine of a CPU, dealing with all the necessary data processing. The control unit (CU) is more like the brain of the computer. It coordinates the different hardwares in response to the programs instructions, and passes on the arithmetic and logical data to the rest of the computer. This makes the ALU completely dependent on the CU, but not vice versa.


## CPU, Input and Output
* Identify how the example addresses each of the components: CPU, Input and Output

Their desktop milling machine takes in inputs from the keyboard and mouse. The keypresses are then converted to binary and are sent to the CPU. The CPU then accesses memory to store the letter B as pixels in binary. The pixels then get outputed through the computer screen which uses the binary to depict each pixel on the screen. 

# Data Representation

## Numeric Conversions
* Explain the difference between decimal, binary and hexadecimal numbers

The main difference is what base each number system uses. Decimal uses base 10, binary uses base 2, and hexadecimal uses base 16.

# Conclusion

It was very interesting to learn more in depth about what makes computers function. Computers play such a huge part in our lives nowadays, and we take for granted how amazing it is that these machines are constantly doing thousands and maybe millions of operations in mere seconds.
